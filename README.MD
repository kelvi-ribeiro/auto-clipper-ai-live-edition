### Introduction

This Python project utilizes artificial intelligence to perform intelligent video cuts based on detected keywords in audio. When a specific word, such as "cut" (configurable as a parameter), is identified, the program automatically segments the video, which can be repeated throughout the entire video. The goal is to simplify the editing of lengthy videos using these tools.

### Backlog:

- Implement video cutting by gesture.
- Implement automatic cutting after detecting keywords; use default time if not detected.
- Estimate processing time.
- Test from scratch on Windows.
- Implement partial processing to resume from interruption points in videos.
